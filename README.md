# Breast-Cancer-Analysis-Classification-

Breast cancer is one of the most widely spread disease and the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Breast cancer starts when malignant lumps which are cancerous begin to grow from the breast cells. 

There is need for computer aided detection (CAD) systems which use machine learning approaches to provide accurate diagnosis of breast cancer. 

This analysis aims at investigating different machine learning techniques &  to integrate them with feature selection/feature extraction methods and compare their performances to identify the most suitable approach.

Project Description :

Primary Goal :
    To predict if the cancerous tissue is benign or malignant. 

Secondary Goals :
 To look for general trends that can help with model selection and hyper-parameter  selection.
 To see which features are most useful in predicting whether a cancer is malignant or benign.
 To develop functions that can predict the discrete class of new input using data science classification algorithms.
